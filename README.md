Sample project with Maven
=========================

This is just a sample project with a `pom.xml` file that will:

* compile a single JAR (without dependencies)
* create an executable JAR (with dependencies)

It's just here to give me a faster heads up rather than relying on the maven archetype.


Build commands
--------------

    mvn package
    java -jar target/zilla-0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
